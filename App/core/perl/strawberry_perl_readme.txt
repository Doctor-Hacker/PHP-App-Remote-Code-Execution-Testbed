 distribution is installed. DO NOT remove this file unless

Perl options
------------
 Uniform Server allows you to install one of two Perl distributions,
 either Strawberry Perl (Option 1) or Active State Perl (Option2)

 Option 1: Strawberry Perl
   Strawberry Perl’s licensing allows its distribution to be
   repackaged and freely downloadable. The Uniform Steel Perl
   plugin installs Strawberry Perl to appropriate folders.
   Note: Llicenses are located in folder
   UniServer\docs\licenses\strawberry_perl 


 Option 2: Active State Perl 
  Active State Perl’s licensing prevents repackaging and
  distribution hence the need to download their package
  and use The Uniform Steel’s integrated installer see
  documentation for details.

------------
Install Perl
------------
 Installing is a misnomer! Nothing is installed to your PCs registry all
 files are extracted to their appropriate location within the UniServer
 folder structure. 

 Before installing a Perl distribution delete any previous version by
 deleting folder: UniServer\core\perl

 Option 1: Install Strawberry Perl
  Download Perl plugin and save to folder UniServer and extract.

 Option 2: Install Active State Perl
  Following the instruction contained in the Server documentation
