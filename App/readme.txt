PHP-App-Remote-Code-Execution-Testbed

Purpose: This application has been designed to allow the user to practice remote code execution techniques against real applications without the hassle of installing the apps. It has been build under "Uniform Server" (UniServerZ) which is a free lightweight WAMP (Windows/Apache/MySQL/Php) server solution for Windows. UniServerZ runs from a USB (or in this case, a single folder). The vulnerable PHP apps have been downloaded mainly from https://www.exploit-db.com

The apps can be exploited (1) Using manual techniques (2) Using exploits that are available on the Internet (e.g. exploit-db.com or github). There are exploits available for each of these apps (I have checked to make sure they work). My students also create their own exploits as part of an exploit writing module.

Usage: run menu.bat.
